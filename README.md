# StudyRush
## Overview
StudyRush is a productivity timer designed to help users stay on track with their tasks. When the timer runs out, *StudyBomb will delete a user-specified directory as a consequence, adding an extra layer of motivation!
- Important note: **StudyRush will also delete all subdirectories!**

## Key Features
- **Productivity Timer**: Set a time before the selected file is deleted. To facilitate productivity, this timer _cannot normally be paused._
- **Task List** - Create a list of tasks. To stop the timer and prevent file deletion, all tasks must be completed.

  - Create subtasks within tasks. To clear the task, all subtasks must be completed.
  
- **Safety Mechanisms**: 
  - Confirmation prompts before timer begins.
  - A grace period for file deletion if no activity has been detected for 5 minutes.
  - An optional toggle to enable cancellation of the timer.
