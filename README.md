# StudyBomb (WIP) - the timer & productivity program with consequences!
Note: This is a temporary README! More details forthcoming.


# Description
This is a productivity timer that, with the user's consent, will delete a chosen filepath upon time running out. The only way to prevent this from occuring is completing all the tasks the user inputs before the timer begins.

# Why??
I found that I worked best under strict deadlines and consequences, but self-imposed consequences are often difficult to enforce. This was my solution, I guess.

If it wasn't obvious enough, all permanent actions are done with the user's explicit consent. Ample warnings and saveguards are provided, and the user can abort the timer at any time. I take no responsibility for lost or damaged files.
